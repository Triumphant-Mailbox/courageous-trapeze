## Development

### Google Account

In order to enable the Google contacts import, a Google account, Google Contacts API key, and Google Client ID are required. Details on how to set up all these components can be found on the [Google Contacts](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/) API page.

Once you have your own Google API key and Google Client ID, set them in the `Contacts` factory in `factories.js`.

```sh
sudo npm install -g bower
